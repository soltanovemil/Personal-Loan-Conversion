# Bank Loan Prediction Project

This repository contains the code and analysis for a predictive modeling project focused on predicting the likelihood of customers accepting personal loans in a banking context. The dataset, sourced from Thera Bank, includes customer demographic information, banking relationships, and responses to previous campaigns.

## Project Highlights:

- **Objective:** The primary goal is to predict the conversion of liability customers to personal loan customers, aiding in targeted marketing strategies.
  
- **Data Exploration:** Explored customer demographics, banking relationships, and responses to previous campaigns through statistical summaries and visualizations.
  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and performed exploratory data analysis to prepare the dataset for machine learning models.
  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implemented logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers to predict personal loan acceptance.
  
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for anomaly detection and visualization.

This project provides valuable insights into customer behavior and serves as a foundation for data-driven decision-making in banking campaigns.
